# Java RPG 

Warning: WIP in early stages.

The purpose of this project is to build a bullet hell 2d game with some RPG mechanics using pure Java. You'll explore 20+ zones in a post-apocalyptic world, completing quests, gaining new skills, and defeating bosses, in a quest to bring progress to your village using the ancient world's knowledge and technology.
As of now, there are already three playable levels, a whole questline, and original soundtrack for the levels.

Features:

- [x] Moddable XML-based questing system
- [x] MIDI music system (might be replaced with mp3)
- [x] Enemies, items, power-ups, static turrets, and environment (rocks, trees, etc.)
- [x] Command console for debugging purposes
- [x] Moddable tile level format
- [ ] Saving system
- [ ] Main menu
- [ ] Player skills tied to experience points
- [ ] Original soundtrack (WIP)
- [ ] Boss battles

## How to run 

- Clone the repo
- Run ./gradlew run

Java version: 21

## Packaging

I personally use packr-all.jar, a tool developed by the libgdx team. Example:
java -jar packr-all-4.0.0.jar --platform windows64 --jdk /jdk-21.0.7-full/ --useZgcIfSupportedOs --executable javarpg --classpath app/build/libs/javarpg.jar --mainclass rpg.App --output out-win

Note that I use the Liberica jdk/jre because they already ship JavaFX

## Controls

Controls are for now statically fixed:
- Arrows for movement
- "E" to interact with things and NPCs
- "R" for shooting an ice ball
- "C" for opening the command console
- "P" for pausing the game
