# Java RPG 

Warning: WIP in very early stages.

The purpose of this project is to build an RPG with a gameplay similar to WoW: level up by doing quests in the world in order to get into the end-game content, which will consist of dungeons. In principle, it will be single player, but that may change.

## How to run 

- Clone the repo
- Run ./gradlew run
